# Just Report It Thunderbird Plugin

## Introduction ##

Just Report It (<https://justreport.it>) is an email plugin which makes it easy to report spam emails back to the domain registrar. This method ensures that spam domains are effetively being blocked at the registrar level and not just locally.

## Custom Setup ##

To run this plugin locally, you will need to run your own Just Report It server and update the api key value (x-api-key) found in the "background.js" file.
